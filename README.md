<b>EcoFin</b> is a Python library developed for financial quantitative analysts and developers.
The final goal is to provide a library that covers most of the topics related to quantitative finance:
* Financial mathematics tools
* Stochastical processes tools
* Montecarlo simulations
* Financial statistical tools
* Option pricing using binomial tree models
* Black, Scholes and Merton model
* Option greeks analysis
* Volatility smile/surface computation
* Equity VIX computation (classical and CBOE method)
* Markowitz asset allocation model
* Black and Litterman asset allocation model
* Implied Volatility Spread (IVS) analysis
* Option Price Spread (OPS) analysis


The strength of this project is to enclose in a single library all the quantitative finance functions from data download to data analysis, in order to realize complete investment strategies.<br>
To start using this library, take a look at the <a href="/Examples/">Examples</a> folder.

To install the library type
```{r test-python, engine='python'}
pip install EcoFin
```

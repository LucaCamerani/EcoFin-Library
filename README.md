* Financial mathematics tools
* Stochastical processes tools
* Montecarlo simulations
* Financial statistical tools
* Option pricing using binomial tree models
* Black, Scholes and Merton model
* Option greeks analisys
* Volatility smile/surface computation
* Equity VIX computation (classical and CBOE method)
* Markowitz asset allocation model
* Black and Litterman asset allocation model
* Implied Volatility Spread (IVS) analisys
* Option Price Spread (OPS) analisys


The streght of this project is to enclose in a single library all the quantitative finance functions from data download to data analisys, in order to realize complete investment strategies.<br>
